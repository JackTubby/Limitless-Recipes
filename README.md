#### Colours
I have chosen these set of colours for my website:

* #116466 
* #D1E8E2 
* #FFCB9A 
* white
* black

#### Typography
* "Lexend Mega" Used for main pecies of content like titles and headings.
* "Lato" Used for most of the text throughout the website, as it is a clean font and makes it very user-friendly and easy to read.
